# Street-Debater
Street debating is a job aimed at bridging the social divide by creating a platform for open dialogue. During the my time at Delft University of Technology, this job was conceived as a new method for homeless people in Europe to earn money without losing their dignity, offering an alternative to begging. Street debate uses a board with a question written on it, and a balance-like tool with two options for answers, inviting passers-by to cast their vote. Through the debate, money is placed on the scales, making public opinion visible. The interactions that take place are not based on a "giver" and "receiver" relationship, but rather on friendly dialogue, and through these interactions, it is hoped to rebuild the connection between the homeless and society. In fact, there are individuals who got out of the streets in London through this job.
